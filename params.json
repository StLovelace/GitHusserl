{"name":"The Open Husserl Archives","tagline":"GitHusserl: Lab Notebooks, Lectures, and Seminar Translations","body":"![Edmund Husserl with pipe.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-g9EW7CR9MLw/T0ElpnF04nI/AAAAAAAABKo/BNzZyzdA9l0/s1600/Husserl.jpg)\r\nEdmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl (April 8, 1859 – April 27, 1938) was a mathematician (a student of Königsberger and Weierstrass) and a psychologist (a student of Wundt, Brentano, and Stumpf). He became a philosopher as one called to the vocation on behalf of science. An autodidact driven to fundamental accounts, Husserl read and corresponded with scientists and scholars from across the academy (see his 10 volumes of letters: _[Edmund Husserl Briefwechsel: Die Brentanoschule](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780792319252)_). Together these made him the founder of phenomenology.\r\n\r\n### The Monastery.\r\nIn 2010, the monks and nuns of St. Lovelace (@stlovelacemonastery) began working toward the Open Husserl Archives. In 2013 they founded [GitHusserl](https://github.com/StLovelace/GitHusserl) to begin to attend to the seed of this work. In 2015 some of the private repository began to be released.\r\n\r\n### The Repo. \r\nThere are thousands of critical translations of manuscripts and fragments scattered across the literature, dissertation archives, and the internet. It seems high time to have a place to aggregate these works of scholarship that are already available, but so difficult to acquire. A place that insulates itself from the politics and commerce of such things. \r\n\r\n### The Work. \r\nDorion Cairns once called Husserl's workshop in Freiburg a _[Philosophical Seminary](http://books.google.com/books?id=93x5pddISMMC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=%22husserl's+philosophical+seminary%22&source=bl&ots=fYpwyOCH9P&sig=iPSwQdjBbAqvi1NV4Nae0IZfOng&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_R1AUqCtCJL0rAHE5oHIDA&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22husserl's%20philosophical%20seminary%22&f=false)_. We believe this phrase, in all of its beautiful anachronism, communicates something true about the mission that phenomenology is engaged in and the manner in which those who would contribute come into doing so. Philosophy as a rigorous science is yet underway. The opening up of the Nachlass to an ever wider readership is absolutely required to move forward. We've crafted some places to begin and look forward to your help to begin again. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with GitHub?
