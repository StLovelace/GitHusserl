Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl (April 8, 1859 – April 27, 1938) was a mathematician (a student of Königsberger and Weierstrass) and a psychologist (a student of Wundt, Brentano, and Stumpf). He became a philosopher as one called to the vocation on behalf of science. An autodidact driven to fundamental account giving, Husserl read and corresponded with scientists and scholars from across academia (see his 10 volumes of letters: <em><a href="https://hiw.kuleuven.be/hua/editionspublications/husserliana-dokumente">Briefwechsel</a></em>). At the turn of the Twentieth Century he became the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl">founder of phenomenology</a>.</p>

<p>Dorion Cairns once called Husserl's workshop a <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=93x5pddISMMC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=%22husserl's+philosophical+seminary%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fYpwyOCH9P&amp;sig=iPSwQdjBbAqvi1NV4Nae0IZfOng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_R1AUqCtCJL0rAHE5oHIDA&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22husserl's%20philosophical%20seminary%22&amp;f=false">philosophical seminary</a></em>. We believe this phrase, in all of its beautiful anachronism, communicates something true about the work that phenomenology is engaged in and the manner in which those who would contribute come into doing so. In 2010, the monks and nuns of St. Lovelace (<a href="https://github.com/stlovelacemonastery" class="user-mention">@stlovelacemonastery</a>) began working toward the Open Husserl Archives. In 2013 we founded <a href="https://github.com/StLovelace/GitHusserl">GitHusserl</a> to begin to digitally curate the seed of this work. In 2015 some of the private repository began to be released.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-work" class="anchor" href="#the-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Work.</h3>

<p>The opening up of the Husserlian <em>Nachlass</em> to a wider readership is necessary if the highest aims of phenomenology are to remain a viable research program. As with all rigorous pursuits, philosophy as a strict science demands meaningful problems, well-conceived methods, and a community of investigators able to reliably produce data together. Seeing the evidence of these things in the working texts of Husserl benefits those who would take up this charge today. </p>

<h3>
<a id="the-repo" class="anchor" href="#the-repo" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Repo.</h3>

<p>There are thousands of critical and computational translations of manuscripts and fragments scattered across the literature, dissertation archives, and the internet. It is time to have a place to aggregate these works of scholarship that are available but difficult to acquire--a place that insulates itself from the politics and commerce of the market and the academy. The St. Lovelace <a href="https://github.com/StLovelace/GitHusserl/releases">OHA repository</a> is one such place on the outer fray of the digital humanities. We have worked out some ways to begin and look forward to your help to begin again. </p>
